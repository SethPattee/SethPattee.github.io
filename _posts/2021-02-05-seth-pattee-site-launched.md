Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. Huge thanks to Jonathan McGlone and his [site](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) and to Don Gruber for his fantastic [site](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) about Markdown. This wouldn't be here without them.
