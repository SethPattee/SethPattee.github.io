## Paragraphs, Headers, Blockquotes ##

This is me practicing using paragraphs. (paragraph: a distinct section of a piece of writing, usually dealing with a single theme and indicated by a new line, indentation, or numbering.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with
spaces or tabs.
I am going to practice:
A First Level Header
====================
    
A Second Level Header
---------------------

### Header 3
    > This is the start of a blockquote.
    > 
    > This what a second paragraph in the blockquote looks like.
    >
    > ## This is an H2 in a blockquote and what it looks like
    
    
### Phrase Emphasis ###
    So this is *cool*.
    Not only that _so it this _.
    
    2 might be **a little much**.
    so is __this__.
